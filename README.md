**Presenting repo of our team iPhaseNet**

Deep Learning for Inverse Problems in Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM):

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation for reconstructing quantitative Atomic Electrostatic Potentials (in Volts) from multi-segment STEM images. By integrating metadata (sample thickness and rotation) with visual data, the model solves the inverse physics problem, recovering atomic structure with high fidelity (~54dB PSNR).
